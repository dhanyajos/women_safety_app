    <string name="intro">
        Abuja Electricity Distribution Company - Complaint Management System, AEDC-CMS is an electricity distribution company that came into operation in 2010 after the privatization of power holding company of Nigeria (PHCN) by its sole owner, the Federal government of Nigeria. \n
        This privatization was due to PHCN not living up to its statutory function, which was to develop and maintain an efficient, co-ordinate and economical system of electricity supply throughout the federation. For a company like AEDC with millions of clients in Lokoja, it is difficult if not nearly impossible to satisfy every customerâ€™s need, chiefly because of lack of adequate platform for customers to express their dissatisfaction and receive response effectively and efficiently.\n 
        Although the company has its manual way of collecting complaint via complaint box which is burdensome and time consuming because the customer will have to go to the office, write his complaint and post it in the box, which at the end of the day may not be attended to. Furthermore in cases of emergency of fire outbreak, perhaps due to transformer overloading which might cause electricity zapping on high tension wire, an effective, efficient and responsive complaint system will be needed to curb the situation, else there will be fire outbreak, and this could lead to loss of goods and properties and might also lead to loss of life.</string>
